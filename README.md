The JavaScript code for the portfolio website dynamically populates the Skills and Projects sections and manages the contact form. It begins by creating a list of skills from a predefined array, appending each skill as a list item (<li>) to the skills list. Next, it generates project entries by looping through an array of project objects, creating a div for each project that includes an image and description, and appending these to the projects container. For form handling, the script prevents the default form submission action, displays a thank-you message to the user via an alert, and resets the form for new input. This approach ensures that the website content is automatically generated and interactive, enhancing user engagement and experience.
